# Predicting Asthma Prevalence Using Geographically Weighted Random Forest (GWRF)

This project deals with predicting and analyzing geographic patterns of asthma prevalence across the United States using advanced spatial machine learning techniques. By leveraging the CDC PLACES dataset, which provides detailed health information at the census tract level, the research aims to understand how asthma rates vary across different locations and what factors influence these variations.

The project employs Geographically Weighted Random Forest (GWRF), an innovative approach that combines traditional random forest machine learning with geographic weighting. This method is particularly powerful for health outcome analysis as it accounts for spatial relationships that standard statistical models might miss. For instance, environmental factors, healthcare access, and socioeconomic conditions that affect asthma rates often vary significantly by location.

Using the CASTHMA (current asthma prevalence) indicator from the CDC PLACES dataset, the analysis explores how various health behaviors and social determinants contribute to asthma prevalence in different geographic areas. The GWRF model's unique ability to consider spatial heterogeneity helps identify regional hotspots and understand local risk factors that might be overlooked in global models.

The research has practical implications for public health planning and policy development. By identifying areas with higher asthma prevalence and understanding the local factors contributing to these rates, healthcare providers and policymakers can develop more targeted and effective interventions. This geographic approach to health analysis is particularly valuable for addressing health disparities and improving resource allocation in communities with the greatest need.

The methodology developed in this project can serve as a framework for analyzing other chronic diseases where geographic factors play a significant role, potentially leading to more effective, location-specific public health strategies.
