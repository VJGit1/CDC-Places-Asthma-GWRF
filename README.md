# CDC-Places-Asthma-GWRF
This project deals with predicting and analyzing geographic patterns of asthma prevalence across USA. By using CDC PLACES dataset, I have tried to understand how asthma rates vary across different locations. Geographically Weighted Random Forest (GWRF),  that combines traditional random forest machine learning with geographic weighting is used.
